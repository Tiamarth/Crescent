# Crescent
A minimal skin for Overwolf with two consecutively less minimal variations.

**Note:** This skin may not still work. I can no longer test it as Overwolf doesn't support Linux and does not run in Wine. If that changes in the future, or if I ever buy a Windows PC, I will pick this project back up.

There are three variations of this skin. The first is minimal, simply called Crescent.  
The second is less minimal, called Crescent: Arctic Blast.  
The third isn't minmimal at all and is called Crescent: Sub Zero.

### Installation instructions:
